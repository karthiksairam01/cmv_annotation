        "t1_cnhq330": "Consider the definition of a prime number. It's a number that is divisible only by itself and 1. \n\nThis is the usual definition given, but by this definition it could be argued that 1 is itself a prime number. After all, it's divisible by itself. And it's also divisible by 1. The two things it needs to be divisible by just happen to be the same thing. So for this reason, there's an additional restriction: 1 is not a prime number.\n\nWhy is that? It's a completely arbitrary restriction. We just threw on a clause at the end that stated 1 isn't prime. It should be prime! So why isn't it?\n\nBecause it's not useful. \n\nPrimes are useful because with them we can do things like construct *unique* prime factorization for example. The prime factorization of 12 is 2, 2, 3 because `2 * 2 * 3 = 12`. But if we allowed 1 to be prime, then we no long have unique prime factorization. We'd also have 1, 2, 2, 3, as well as 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and so on. This is just one example where limiting the definition of what a prime is can be useful. \n\nSo now back to the definition of 'natural'. Yes, the distinction between man made thing and natural things is arbitrary. But we make the distinction because it's useful for categorizing things. We didn't derive the definition from some set of core axioms. We arbitrarily added the clause \"Not made by humans\" so that we could distinguish between things made by people and things done without the influence of people.

When an environmentalist says that unnatural toxins are damaging the environment, what she means is not necessarily just that toxins are artificial, but that by producing them we are somehow upsetting the course of the universe.

        "t1_cni80dr": "I like to think of it as natural products can be found in nature in the form we use them regularly (without the need for a chemical transformation). If the only way the product is created is in a laboratory, factory or anything resulting from human activity than it could be called \"unnatural\", or synthetic/man-made if you want to avoid the negative connotation of unnatural. Even though all transformations from the raw material to the final product must follow natural laws, it does not mean that the transformations would ever occur naturally, without human intervention. Sure you can expand the definition of natural to include these man-made products, but if you were to do that, the word natural loses its ability to describe things and differentiate between things we find and use and things we have to chemically alter or create. If this were the case you would need to describe things as \"not synthetically made\" to gain an edge over man-made products that are marketed as natural.\n\nI'll try to give an example without getting overly scientific but trans fats aren't natural, by this definition. To my knowledge trans fats rarely occur naturally, if ever. This is because when fats are formed, they arrange the elememts in a different orientation, known as cis. One way that the kther form, trans fats are formed is at high heats when the chemical bonds in the fat are broken and the alternative arrangement of bonds is formed in the trans arrangement. If i remeber correctly, one way trans fats are made is when oil is reused after frying. Obviously, no natural laws were broken when the trans fats were made so I guess you could call them natural. However this type of fat is never seen in nature, so when humans digest it, supposedly bad things happen. I think this is because it is in a form that our bodies have never seen before. For this reason I would argue that it's fair to call trans fats unnatural. If you want to change the word so it doesn't interfere with the idea that we are a part of nature call them man-made products or synthetic or something. But I feel as though in order to keep everyone informed about the food they are eating, and products they are buying, there has to be a distinction.\n\nI don't feel like all synthetic products are bad, for example polyester and polymers have changed the world, and continue to do so. Especially the ones that combine different chemicals that are never combined naturally to get the most desirable charecteristics from each separate natural chemical. There are a ton of great man-made products like teflon and other coatings. They just don't occur naturally.\n\nOne more point is that the view that everything is natural is often used to market products, many of the \"natural flavors\" in food are created synthetically. Although I'm not completely sure if the chemicals they make are found in nature, many of them probably do. But this raises another question, does it matter how we obtain the chemicals, or just if they are observed in nature when we use the word natural?\n",

Commonly used for dry sockets after tooth extractions. FDA did recognize it's legitmate use, but I think has started to shy away from recommending it.\n\nAlso certain one probably have some minor antibiotic properties, but I wouldn't recommend them, and dont have many studies.\n\nOverall most probably dont do much good, and some contain toxic compounds which in small amounts consumed or rubbed on skin(serious issue actually) would be fine, but the essential oils make it easier to reach certain levels that may be toxic in the long term.\n\nAlso, some smell good. If it calms you down, that a real effect. If it clears your sinuses, that's a real effect too.\n\nTotal BS? no. Mostly BS? Very possible.",
        "t1_cni06fr": "This is an anecdote, which is specifically not what you asked for. But it's not a pro-essential-oil testimony, so maybe you will find it interesting.\n\nI used to go for regular massages with a group of friends. Just basic back massages using oil, with some essential oils added for \"relaxation\". The first time we went, I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy afterwards and had to sit down for 20-30 minutes till it passed off. Eventually we worked out it was the essential oils - if I got a massage with just carrier oil (almond?) I was fine; if she added essential oils I was sick.\n\nI wouldn't expect something so negative to be a placebo effect (I had either neutral or mildly positive expectations for essential oils). And the effect seemed repeatable and strong. So, I wouldn't say I've found essential oils to be helpful for anything (except making me feel sick) but on the principle that if a drug has a real effect on the body then it should also be able to have side-effects - something natural medicine enthusiasts seem to often ignore - I suppose this has made me more open to the possibility that they have genuine physiological effects.\n\nProbably worth pointing out though that none of my friends had this reaction!\n\nFrom an actual scientific evidence point of view there are at least a few cases where there are real studies to support e.g. tea tree oil having antiseptic properties, but maybe these cases are exceptions.",
        "t1_cnhp0bu": "OK, so, yes, in most cases, essential oils are bullshit when it comes to all this craze about natural healing products and whatnot. But there are some that are SO AWESOME!!! Props to you for being skeptical! Let me see if I can change your view on a couple of oils...\n\nLavender Oil: This is primarily used for relaxation and anxiety relief. There have been several studies performed over many years that have more or less proven this pretty well. I use it myself sometimes after laundering the bedclothes, putting a bit in the pillowcases. I used to foster a really crazy Yorkie, and a tiny dab of the oil on her paws made her unbelievably relaxed and calm.\n\nTea Tree Oil: This is good for minor infections and small wounds. It's endorsed by many doctors, and is even featured on WebMD for these uses (to a lesser extent a LOT of other healing things, but these haven't been studied well.) \n\nPeppermint Oil: While there aren't a lot of conclusive studies available for it, this shit is awesome for digestive issues in my experience when combined with other ingredients. The best medicine I ever had for digestive issues was infused with the stuff. Also, peppermint oil is AMAZING for deterring mosquitoes.\n\nAnyway, the stuff is useful, and typically smells awesome. As long as she isn't destroying her own pocketbook, I think your wife will be fine. The three oils I mentioned (plus a few others) I buy myself at discounts, usually on Amazon, for the uses I mentioned. I don't know what kind of pyramid schemes you're referring to, but anything that is a pyramid scheme is probably bad. :(",
        "t1_cnhppsw": "From my experience:\n\nLavender Oil: My has rubbed the crap on me to \"make me sleepy\".  It does NOT work for me.  Last night, wife put some on a raging baby that we were watching.  It did NOT work. \n\nPeppermint Oil: Wife heard this same thing and, following internet advice, placed a drop upon her tongue.  She said it was the most intense shit's she's ever had. ",
        "t1_cnhwhma": "keep in mind these aren't \"narcotics\". They aren't meant to have those intense effects, as it looks like you are expecting from them. I feel like you are looking at it in a sense that, once you rub the oil on you - then you should feel heavily sedated as if you took valium, or another narcotic. (in particular the lavender example you stated above)",
        "t1_cnho6mi": "I'm not an expert on essential oils, but I know a thing or two about cons.\n\nHere is how I suggest that you approach this: Find your wife's supplier/whatever, and ask them the difficult questions. How does it work? What ailments does it cure? What about the chemistry of these oils makes it work? How does the bacteria/virus/fungus/etc react to these oils in laboratory conditions in a double-blind test?\n\nBasically, if this is another dupe, they'll lead you up the pyramid until you find someone who can either answer your questions, or will start dodging them. Which of these they do will be the proof you need, one way or another.",
        "t1_cnhot32": "This is exactly where I'm at in my view on this stuff but there don't seem to be any answers to these questions, other than claims that they cure just about everything.  Got a headache?  Just rub some of this on your foot.  ",
        "t1_cnhp1pb": "That sounds dangerously like Aromatherapy. I feel like something similar was featured on an episode of Penn &amp; Teller's *Bullshit!* but I'm at work and can't find the clip currently.",
        "t1_cnho7iy": "In the scientific sense, 'essential'  literally means having an essence, in other words having a smell. Essential oils are plant extracts that contain the aromatic compounds of that plant. \n\nThe healing properties are most definitely BS, other than smelling nice and helping you relax they have no proven benefits. \n\nSome might have minor positive effects, for example menthol or mint extract clears the nose and sinuses but that's about it. ",
        "t1_cnhoqp4": "Seems to me that the \"healing effects\" work just like placebos. ",
        "t1_cnhobzs": "I can't speak to your wife's particular situation. It seems likely that the business she's getting involved with is BS. Health and medical claims being slyly implied are almost certainly BS.\n\nBut the oils themselves are a legitimate part of perfumery, candle making and a number of honest crafts that value nice smells.",
        "t1_cnhop4t": "Thanks for the comment, but I'm afraid you are only strengthening my view on this. ",
        "t1_cnhp1nq": "You're saying that they are \"total BS\" and you want your view changed, but they aren't total BS. The health claims are false, but they do have legitimate uses in making candles, scented skin care products, shampoo, etc.  "
