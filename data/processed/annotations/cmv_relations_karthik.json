        "text": "Consider the definition of a prime number. It's a number that is divisible only by itself and 1. \n\nThis is the usual definition given, but by this definition it could be argued that 1 is itself a prime number. After all, it's divisible by itself. And it's also divisible by 1. The two things it needs to be divisible by just happen to be the same thing. So for this reason, there's an additional restriction: 1 is not a prime number.\n\nWhy is that? It's a completely arbitrary restriction. We just threw on a clause at the end that stated 1 isn't prime. It should be prime! So why isn't it?\n\nBecause it's not useful. \n\nPrimes are useful because with them we can do things like construct *unique* prime factorization for example. The prime factorization of 12 is 2, 2, 3 because `2 * 2 * 3 = 12`. But if we allowed 1 to be prime, then we no long have unique prime factorization. We'd also have 1, 2, 2, 3, as well as 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and so on. This is just one example where limiting the definition of what a prime is can be useful. \n\nSo now back to the definition of 'natural'. Yes, the distinction between man made thing and natural things is arbitrary. But we make the distinction because it's useful for categorizing things. We didn't derive the definition from some set of core axioms. We arbitrarily added the clause \"Not made by humans\" so that we could distinguish between things made by people and things done without the influence of people. While we are, in a sense, not separate from nature, we are in a somewhat unique position relative to the rest of nature, so it makes sense to have language we can use to make that distinction.",

        "text": "I like to think of it as natural products can be found in nature in the form we use them regularly (without the need for a chemical transformation). If the only way the product is created is in a laboratory, factory or anything resulting from human activity than it could be called \"unnatural\", or synthetic/man-made if you want to avoid the negative connotation of unnatural. Even though all transformations from the raw material to the final product must follow natural laws, it does not mean that the transformations would ever occur naturally, without human intervention. Sure you can expand the definition of natural to include these man-made products, but if you were to do that, the word natural loses its ability to describe things and differentiate between things we find and use and things we have to chemically alter or create. If this were the case you would need to describe things as \"not synthetically made\" to gain an edge over man-made products that are marketed as natural.\n\nI'll try to give an example without getting overly scientific but trans fats aren't natural, by this definition. To my knowledge trans fats rarely occur naturally, if ever. This is because when fats are formed, they arrange the elememts in a different orientation, known as cis. One way that the kther form, trans fats are formed is at high heats when the chemical bonds in the fat are broken and the alternative arrangement of bonds is formed in the trans arrangement. If i remeber correctly, one way trans fats are made is when oil is reused after frying. Obviously, no natural laws were broken when the trans fats were made so I guess you could call them natural. However this type of fat is never seen in nature, so when humans digest it, supposedly bad things happen. I think this is because it is in a form that our bodies have never seen before. For this reason I would argue that it's fair to call trans fats unnatural. If you want to change the word so it doesn't interfere with the idea that we are a part of nature call them man-made products or synthetic or something. But I feel as though in order to keep everyone informed about the food they are eating, and products they are buying, there has to be a distinction.\n\nI don't feel like all synthetic products are bad, for example polyester and polymers have changed the world, and continue to do so. Especially the ones that combine different chemicals that are never combined naturally to get the most desirable charecteristics from each separate natural chemical. There are a ton of great man-made products like teflon and other coatings. They just don't occur naturally.\n\nOne more point is that the view that everything is natural is often used to market products, many of the \"natural flavors\" in food are created synthetically. Although I'm not completely sure if the chemicals they make are found in nature, many of them probably do. But this raises another question, does it matter how we obtain the chemicals, or just if they are observed in nature when we use the word natural?\n",

While your meaning is a valid (although pointless, because it doesn't make a distinction anymore then) one, another meaning that is often used for natural means \"compatible with nature\". For example, meat grown in vats would be natural because it can be broken down into nutrients and integrate in the natural cycle, but its plastic packaging still isn't natural. Another way to define it is by origin: a forest fire due to summer heat would be natural, a fire lit by humans not.",

        "reply_to_text": "I can't remember the topic that spurred this discussion, but a friend and I were debating whether man-made things were natural. He took the position that they are unnatural. \n\nHe cited this definition by Merriam-Webster:  existing in nature and not made or caused by people : coming from nature (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.\n\nHowever, I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made. However, I think unnatural and man-made are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that man-made things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature. \n\nI would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your responses lads. As many of you pointed out, our argument depends more on the context of the use of the word and I think that my friend and I were arguing about the semantics and definition more than our intended meaning behind use of the word \"natural\"."

        "text": "This is an anecdote, which is specifically not what you asked for. But it's not a pro-essential-oil testimony, so maybe you will find it interesting.\n\nI used to go for regular massages with a group of friends. Just basic back massages using oil, with some essential oils added for \"relaxation\". The first time we went, I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy afterwards and had to sit down for 20-30 minutes till it passed off. Eventually we worked out it was the essential oils - if I got a massage with just carrier oil (almond?) I was fine; if she added essential oils I was sick.\n\nI wouldn't expect something so negative to be a placebo effect (I had either neutral or mildly positive expectations for essential oils). And the effect seemed repeatable and strong. So, I wouldn't say I've found essential oils to be helpful for anything (except making me feel sick) but on the principle that if a drug has a real effect on the body then it should also be able to have side-effects - something natural medicine enthusiasts seem to often ignore - I suppose this has made me more open to the possibility that they have genuine physiological effects.\n\nProbably worth pointing out though that none of my friends had this reaction!\n\nFrom an actual scientific evidence point of view there are at least a few cases where there are real studies to support e.g. tea tree oil having antiseptic properties, but maybe these cases are exceptions.",

I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). \n\nI think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries.

People seem to think that we'll pull at the drop of a hat.  While there are undoubtedly a few a-holes among us that do, the *VAST* majority simply do not think that way.\n\nIn point of fact, *most* people who carry understand the weight of the tool at their disposal.  We understand that if we believe the situation warrants use of a gun then we've decided this is a life-or-death situation.  Thankfully, most average citizens, gun carriers or not, never encounter such situations.  Speaking for myself, I only have once in my life and it was more than 25 years now... and, I managed to survive it without a gun.  But when you do, the alternatives are facing it with a tool that we all know is effective at it's job, or going at it without that tool.  Even though I survived my one such case without a gun I wouldn't want to make the gamble a second time.\n\nNo, the truth is that most people who carry understand that carrying a gun makes you the pussy in the room.  It makes you the person that backs down from any and all confrontations long before they escalate to the point of needing a gun.  They understand that they are the ones that take the insults and just walk away.  We keep our anger in check at all times.\n\nWe're also the ones that are paying attention to our surroundings at all times, not burying our faces in our phones and whatnot, because we understand that situational awareness is the key to staying alive whether you have a gun or not.  We notice the little details.  We move to the other side of the street if we think we see trouble coming (whether it \"looks bad\" or not).  We're the ones that, more importantly, won't even *BE* on that street in the first place.\n\nLike I said, I'm sure you can find examples of people who carry who do so with the wrong mindset.  But if you spend any time around people who do carry you'll quickly realize those people are few and far between.  We're perfectly normal people, just like you, who just so happen to not want to be in a situation where we can't defend our lives.  Simple as that.",

Now imagine that a few people in the audience begin returning fire.  Do you think that all of them are going to correctly identify the original shooter in the confusion?  Do you think that all of the 20% of people with guns in the building will correctly guess that there is only one hostile target?  Now shots are coming from every direction, and the 80% of the crowd without guns have no idea which way they should be running to get to safety.  They are running in every direction, unpredictably entering the line of fire of the people with guns.  Now think about what happens when the police arrive and have no idea who they should consider a threat and who is a friendly, yet need to make that distinction immediately or risk being shot themselves.  \n\nI think in many cases a confusing crossfire resulting in even more deaths is the only realistic outcome we can expect.  There will also be scenarios where all or most of the people in the area being attacked know each other well enough to recognize friend from foe, but in general these kinds of things happen in public places where people are strangers to one another.  In those situations the panic and confusion of adding more gunfire will usually make things worse.  Add in the fact that people are more likely to be killed by their own gun in either a home accident or a suicide than they are of using it to defend themselves and I don't see any reason to believe the proposed scenario would lead to a decrease in deaths."

And the more people in the crowd all acting on their own, with no knowledge of which other shooters they should be shooting and and which ones they should be helping, the worse the situation is going to become.  \n\nI think that scenario is more likely, especially if we start encouraging a social norm that as many people as possible should be prepared to open fire at a moments notice.  So I'll play the odds and say that we should avoid a culture with that expectation.

There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies. These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). \n\nI think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the \"not one of us\" (pack) mentality and escalation of \"police state\".\nChange my view.\n\nPS: I am not here to talk about USA and its gun problems.\n\nEDIT: Awarded a delta to a comment which didn't refute this idea but led me to change my view that it would be best realized with paralyzing weapons rather then guns: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rnr30/cmv_i_think_the_paris_shooting_makes_a_good_case/cni3o83\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Why should I need a gun to defend my life? You and I make the same assumption that dangerous people with guns exist around us, but we see a separate solution to that. One escalates it to more violence, the other does not.\n\nYou're implying that I am much more dangerous on the whole (for a reason you didn't even relate. Guns =/= self-defense). Please explain why.

That means that I don't belong to any of these 'camps' of thought.\n\nWhat do I really do? If I have entered a violent confrontation with someone, then I have already failed. I either avoid such things or solve them diplomatically.\n\nLet's say I have failed already. Well, then I suppose I would dissolve the situation to the best of my ability, ending it as fast as possible or with the least amount of harm to anyone. Would shooting someone be the fastest way? Yes, but it would likely also impart the most harm. Sure there are other ways of killing someone or maiming them without a gun but it is less likely then.\n\nYou must be wondering, then, what do I do if I am being threatened by someone with a gun? Since every situation is different, it's impossible to say. Getting into specifics doesn't really matter if it's with a gun or something else. One specific thing I guess I could say is that I feel like I would be in much higher danger if I had a gun.\n\nAvoiding danger and being safe is the only plan. Every situation is different.\n\nThis isn't such an easy issue, though. I can't just say \"don't get shot\" and be done with it. Unfortunately, the issue is festering and corrupt as it is. We train people to use guns to kill other people. It's one of the most philosophically ridiculous things to exist in our society. There are jobs out there that have the description of giving death to other things.\n\nBecause people can see guns as a way to kill other people, the fear will not fade. To not be afraid is to be blind to the issue.\n\nEventually people may not see guns as a way to kill other people (for whatever reason, please don't argue that this can't happen as that argument would be completely unrelated.) Then it won't matter if someone has a gun.\n\nNot in our lifetime!\n\nIn summary, it is best that the situation in which to defend myself never arises.",

However, the question I have to ask is how do you know the difference and what's your alternate strategy?  Are you of the \"I can always get the police to help\" camp, or the \"I can physically handle myself in any situation\" camp?  What do you do if someone attacks you, with or without a gun?"

This situation and a few others was the early starts of creating swat teams able to respond to armed gunman.\n\nFrance has gun laws allowing citizens to purchase hunting rifles with permits. In the event of something like that happening in the suburbs of France, citizens could respond. \n\nHowever, the situation is so unlikely to occur as shooters rarely take to a single place and shoot from in for such a long period of time. Most shootings happen in an instant and even armed citizens aren't aware of the situation as it is occurring. Police officers and hired guards are constantly in mental preparation of responding to such a situation and know they are expected to take deadly force when they see a lethal situation occurring. If I'm carry my gun all the time but I'm simply going to a super market to pick up groceries I will be reluctant to shoot till I've assessed what is occurring.\n\nAllowing concealed fire arms in a city like Paris to stop the threat of terrorists is a fruitless endeavor.",

        "text": "\"Causation\" is a very deep, complex topic, and when people who are \"explaining causation\" are accused of victim blaming, it's usually because they've taken an approach to causation which is unhelpful, oversimplified, or which misses the important points.\n\nIf we consider a hypothetical violent crime and ask, \"why did this happen?\" it's tempting to think we can boil this question down to one or two or three \"main\" causes. Let's say:\n\n1) Jamie was a habitual violent criminal  \n2) Jamie happened to be in Central Park looking for victims  \n3) Pat chose to walk through Central Park that night  \n4) Pat was unarmed, listening to headphones and not cultivating a lot of situational awareness  \n\nNow, which of these causes is the *real* reason for the assault? What would it even *mean* to say that one of these is a more real, or more important, cause than the others? It seems to me that, as \"cause and effect\" are popularly conceived, we want to be able to set up one-to-one relationships between effects and causes, as if history were some sort of sequential chain.\n\nIn reality, every single one of these conditions is a necessary condition for this assault to take place. If you removed any single one of these \"causes\", the encounter would have happened differently, or not at all. There isn't a \"chain\" of preceding causes for a given event, there's an infinitely branching family tree of causal ancestors.\n\nAnd in addition to these four causes, there are countless others which we didn't have time to list, such as:\n\n5) there were no police officers in visual range at the moment when Jamie and Pat crossed paths  \n6) Jamie didn't sprain an ankle going downstairs for breakfast that morning  \n7) Pat wasn't struck by a meteorite on the way to the park  \n8) A butterfly flapped its wings a few weeks ago\n\nSo none of this is news, and I think we're all pretty familiar with the idea that the future is a great big mess of intersecting and mutually-interfering causes, effects, and conditions, which can only be navigated probabilistically and heuristically. Our decisions about *which* causes and effects to focus on, in order to bring about the sorts of outcomes we want, must be motivated accordingly. The question which matters is not \"do victims ever *cause* their own victimization?\", because the answer to that is trivially yes. I can avoid car accidents by staying in bed all day every day, and in that sense, I am the \"cause\" of anything which *ever* happens to me, by virtue of the fact that I chose to get up and get dressed that day.\n\nThe more meaningful question to ask, is \"whose behaviour can be changed, and how, in order to optimize expected outcomes?\" I could easily avoid car accidents if nothing else mattered to me, but I have places to go and people to see so I make compromises, cross streets, and even jaywalk sometimes for my own convenience. None of this is reason to conclude that I don't know cars are dangerous.\n\nThe people who get accused of victim-blaming, IMHO, have usually failed to consider or address this second question in any meaningful or novel way - and the fact that they bother to express their thoughts on the topic *at all*, usually carries with it an implicit (and very condescending) assumption that the recipient of their 'helpful advice', the person actually *facing* the risk, hasn't already given the question any deep consideration of their own. Women are *well aware* that there are rapists out there. Black people are *painfully cognizant* of the fact that police departments have a racism problem. If anyone is acting, to your eye, as if they didn't know this was the case, the misunderstanding is almost certainly on your end.\n\nThere is nobody out there saying \"Oh wow! I never realized I could make myself safer by voluntarily refraining from some of the fun, risky behaviours which other people engage in!\" Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety *when they were supposed to have both*. When something bad happens, there will *always, always always* be someone around to say \"well you could have made yourself 5% less likely to be targeted by doing X\", and the only way to *not* receive this kind of useless advice from someone, would be to stay home all day every day. And if you die unscathed, poor and lonely after a lifetime of playing it safe, *even then*, there will be others who advise you to \"live a little!\" and observe that you could have created a better life for yourself by taking more risks.\n\nIt's not \"victim blaming\" to observe that victims have opportunities to reduce the risks they face, but it's condescending to imagine that you have better insights into how to do this than they do, or to assume that the reason they don't is that they just didn't know they could.",
        "reply_relation": "a",
        "reply_to_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification.

They want to understand why this thing happened, so that victims don't pile up. Usually when a crime is committed, it's assumed the aggressor is beyond good sense in the first place. Otherwise they wouldn't likely be committing crimes. But we *can* help potential victims by advising them not to put themselves at needless risk.

        "reply_to_text": "\"Causation\" is a very deep, complex topic, and when people who are \"explaining causation\" are accused of victim blaming, it's usually because they've taken an approach to causation which is unhelpful, oversimplified, or which misses the important points.\n\nIf we consider a hypothetical violent crime and ask, \"why did this happen?\" it's tempting to think we can boil this question down to one or two or three \"main\" causes. Let's say:\n\n1) Jamie was a habitual violent criminal  \n2) Jamie happened to be in Central Park looking for victims  \n3) Pat chose to walk through Central Park that night  \n4) Pat was unarmed, listening to headphones and not cultivating a lot of situational awareness  \n\nNow, which of these causes is the *real* reason for the assault? What would it even *mean* to say that one of these is a more real, or more important, cause than the others? It seems to me that, as \"cause and effect\" are popularly conceived, we want to be able to set up one-to-one relationships between effects and causes, as if history were some sort of sequential chain.\n\nIn reality, every single one of these conditions is a necessary condition for this assault to take place. If you removed any single one of these \"causes\", the encounter would have happened differently, or not at all. There isn't a \"chain\" of preceding causes for a given event, there's an infinitely branching family tree of causal ancestors.\n\nAnd in addition to these four causes, there are countless others which we didn't have time to list, such as:\n\n5) there were no police officers in visual range at the moment when Jamie and Pat crossed paths  \n6) Jamie didn't sprain an ankle going downstairs for breakfast that morning  \n7) Pat wasn't struck by a meteorite on the way to the park  \n8) A butterfly flapped its wings a few weeks ago\n\nSo none of this is news, and I think we're all pretty familiar with the idea that the future is a great big mess of intersecting and mutually-interfering causes, effects, and conditions, which can only be navigated probabilistically and heuristically. Our decisions about *which* causes and effects to focus on, in order to bring about the sorts of outcomes we want, must be motivated accordingly. The question which matters is not \"do victims ever *cause* their own victimization?\", because the answer to that is trivially yes. I can avoid car accidents by staying in bed all day every day, and in that sense, I am the \"cause\" of anything which *ever* happens to me, by virtue of the fact that I chose to get up and get dressed that day.\n\nThe more meaningful question to ask, is \"whose behaviour can be changed, and how, in order to optimize expected outcomes?\" I could easily avoid car accidents if nothing else mattered to me, but I have places to go and people to see so I make compromises, cross streets, and even jaywalk sometimes for my own convenience. None of this is reason to conclude that I don't know cars are dangerous.\n\nThe people who get accused of victim-blaming, IMHO, have usually failed to consider or address this second question in any meaningful or novel way - and the fact that they bother to express their thoughts on the topic *at all*, usually carries with it an implicit (and very condescending) assumption that the recipient of their 'helpful advice', the person actually *facing* the risk, hasn't already given the question any deep consideration of their own. Women are *well aware* that there are rapists out there. Black people are *painfully cognizant* of the fact that police departments have a racism problem. If anyone is acting, to your eye, as if they didn't know this was the case, the misunderstanding is almost certainly on your end.\n\nThere is nobody out there saying \"Oh wow! I never realized I could make myself safer by voluntarily refraining from some of the fun, risky behaviours which other people engage in!\" Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety *when they were supposed to have both*. When something bad happens, there will *always, always always* be someone around to say \"well you could have made yourself 5% less likely to be targeted by doing X\", and the only way to *not* receive this kind of useless advice from someone, would be to stay home all day every day. And if you die unscathed, poor and lonely after a lifetime of playing it safe, *even then*, there will be others who advise you to \"live a little!\" and observe that you could have created a better life for yourself by taking more risks.\n\nIt's not \"victim blaming\" to observe that victims have opportunities to reduce the risks they face, but it's condescending to imagine that you have better insights into how to do this than they do, or to assume that the reason they don't is that they just didn't know they could.",

The question of whether it's worthwhile to tell people stuff, depends on a couple of conditions:\n\n1) whether or not they already knew the facts you're conveying  \n2) whether or not the knowledge in question is of any value to them.\n\nI've already gone over why it's condescending to make unfounded presumptions about 1), but this \"autonomy\" stuff all contributes to how we should evaluate 2). When someone interrupts your dinner to tell you about a phone company promotional offer, the aforementioned 2 assumptions are both at play: the advertiser is expressing an implicit assumption that you *didn't know* you could get unlimited domestic calling for only $8.95 a month,  which is probably a fair assumption if the promotion is new and insufficiently publicized, but also they're expressing an implicit assumption that *knowing about this deal would change your decision in any way,* and furthermore that *this knowledge(and the opportunity to act on it) is worth more to you than an uninterrupted dinner*.\n\nThis 2) thing, is an assumption about your priorities, about how much you value your time and money, and about what other long-distance options you have at your disposal. I daresay it's this second assumption which makes us mad at telemarketers, even when we legitimately didn't know about the deal being offered.\n\n(How much worse would it be if the deal they were offering you, was just the exact same deal which you'd already been hearing about from every long-distance carrier for years?

That they are not deemed at fault for the collision doesn't change that.\n\nIn my admittedly limited experience, very few people are both skilled drivers and consistent practitioners of defensive driving. How many people consistently scan all of their mirrors, especially when stopped, or maintain both a safe speed and adequate following distance? Never look away from the road in front for more than 2-3 seconds at a time? Leave a gap when pulling up to an intersection to aid in escaping being rear-ended? Scan every intersection before entering? Attempt to maintain a staggered formation when driving on the highway? Never drive when fatigued, unwell, or otherwise unable to focus fully on the road?\n\n&gt;Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety when they were supposed to have both.\n\nI think one of the more crucial points of debate is whether or not their framing and evaluation of that decision is relevant or a valid target for criticism. I agree that many, even most cases are reflexive or ideologically motivated and can be fairly described as victim blaming, but the current trend is very much to tar *any* questioning of a victim's decisions with that brush. It may be good for the victim (I don't think it invariably is, but that's another debate) but it does a serious disservice to their agency.",

        "reply_to_text": "\"Causation\" is a very deep, complex topic, and when people who are \"explaining causation\" are accused of victim blaming, it's usually because they've taken an approach to causation which is unhelpful, oversimplified, or which misses the important points.\n\nIf we consider a hypothetical violent crime and ask, \"why did this happen?\" it's tempting to think we can boil this question down to one or two or three \"main\" causes. Let's say:\n\n1) Jamie was a habitual violent criminal  \n2) Jamie happened to be in Central Park looking for victims  \n3) Pat chose to walk through Central Park that night  \n4) Pat was unarmed, listening to headphones and not cultivating a lot of situational awareness  \n\nNow, which of these causes is the *real* reason for the assault? What would it even *mean* to say that one of these is a more real, or more important, cause than the others? It seems to me that, as \"cause and effect\" are popularly conceived, we want to be able to set up one-to-one relationships between effects and causes, as if history were some sort of sequential chain.\n\nIn reality, every single one of these conditions is a necessary condition for this assault to take place. If you removed any single one of these \"causes\", the encounter would have happened differently, or not at all. There isn't a \"chain\" of preceding causes for a given event, there's an infinitely branching family tree of causal ancestors.\n\nAnd in addition to these four causes, there are countless others which we didn't have time to list, such as:\n\n5) there were no police officers in visual range at the moment when Jamie and Pat crossed paths  \n6) Jamie didn't sprain an ankle going downstairs for breakfast that morning  \n7) Pat wasn't struck by a meteorite on the way to the park  \n8) A butterfly flapped its wings a few weeks ago\n\nSo none of this is news, and I think we're all pretty familiar with the idea that the future is a great big mess of intersecting and mutually-interfering causes, effects, and conditions, which can only be navigated probabilistically and heuristically.

Let's take your example: \n\n&gt;The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged.\n\nActually, it would have also prevented your being mugged had you left 10 minutes later. It further likely would have prevented your mugging had one of you been armed. If the mugger's spouse had a fight with them before they left the house to mug you, and this delayed them so you passed before they did, it would have prevented your mugging. \n\nYour being mugged is a *statistical* outcome, not attributable to any one behavior on your part. In this case, the root cause is exactly and only the mugger choosing to mug you. There's no other causal factor that would have actually *prevented* the situation, only changed the probabilities, and you can't really trust probabilities to guide specific behavior in specific situations. \n\nAbsolute \"causation\" isn't a helpful concept in cases like this. The causal factors of one individual trial of a statistical experiment aren't very important. The response to a statistical problem is not to change behavior on individual trials of the experiment, it's to address the root cause of the statistical problem. \n\nWe can't, nor should we, do everything in our power to reduce all possibility of danger. Surely you can see the reductio ad absurdum here. \n\nWe have to weigh the effectiveness of our strategies against the costs and benefits. If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let's convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you \"should\" not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged.\n\nIt's not necessarily \"wrong\" to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make return-on-investment calculations, if that's your real goal. It's not too helpful, because people don't really have enough information, nor training in statistical theory, to apply that information. \n\nBut it's really very hard to come up with true valuations of these factors. Don't make the mistake of thinking that because it's \"obvious to you\" that a part of town is dangerous that it is worthwhile to tell someone they should avoid that part of town. \n\nIf you want to tell people in general that traveling in that part of town has a 0.01% chance of resulting in their being mugged and robbed of their pocket change (let's say the average is $100, with another $900 in lost peace of mind), by all means let them know that the expected cost of that behavior is $0.10, so that they can decide if it's worth that cost to them.\n\nAnd that's about accurate for the most dangerous parts of any town, and for actual losses typically incurred. If you exaggerate the danger, you're not doing anyone any favors, and are actually doing them harm, statistically.\n\nWhen you talk to an actual *victim* about these things, realize that they *already* probably have a vastly inflated opinion about the risks of their behavior, because they have suffered an unlikely outcome in that regard. \n\nAlmost in every case, if you're speaking to a *victim*, it would be more accurate to *downplay* the risks that they took, if your goal is to actually statistically help them. \n\nIf someone is in a plane crash and is injured, your telling them that riding planes is dangerous is true as far as it goes... it's just a lot less dangerous than driving, which is what they're likely to do instead. \n\nSocietally speaking, we have to be very careful what we warn people about, because everyone's mileage varies.

        "reply_relation": "a",
        "reply_to_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm saying that even when you *are* engaging in causal victim blaming, when the recklessness was high enough, it can be justified.  That's not to say that you have to do that every time you talk about causation though.

I think you're just conveniently only paying attention to the times where it clearly isn't justified and ignoring the times where it is to draw this conclusion.  For example, how many times do drunk drivers damage their cars or themselves?  People will invariably say they are to blame for what they did, and the same goes for other similar actions.  You have no statistics as to how often that occurs vs how often people fallaciously blame rape victims, so you can make no claims about \"the vast majority\" either way.\n\n&gt; You really won't very often hear someone say it's \"victim blaming\" if you tell a person who fell while balancing on the wall of the Grand Canyon that he was an idiot. \n\nExactly.

It's blaming victims that aren't actually blameworthy that's inappropriate, which you are confusing with the broader statement.\n\n&gt; Among other things... they aren't really victims, because they weren't victimized. \n\nIf you think the word \"victim\" requires there to be some external perpetrator, all I can tell you is that you're mistaken.\n\n",

It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThis paragraph makes a couple of assumptions involving how our culture views \"cause\" and responsibility.  From a deterministic point of view, where you still have the freedom to choose where you go but everything else is predetermined, you entering a bad area is the \"cause\" of your mugging.  But that doesn't make you responsible for being mugged, because every individual is, legally, recognized as having the same freedom of choice that you have.  So the mugger chose to mug you.  That choice was the \"cause,\" not your decision to enter an unsafe area.\n\nYou increasing your chance of being mugged didn't actually cause your mugging.\n\nMaybe this is just pedantic, because ultimately there is a correlation between entering that area and getting mugged.  However, problems arise when people think they know how certain things correlate when they actually don't.  Humans are actually quite bad at probabilities and intuitively understanding them.  So it then becomes a problem when people think \"i'm not blaming the victim, I'm recognizing a correlation,\" because they don't usually have a good reason to believe that they are really recognizing a correlation.\n\nA great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing.  First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.  But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing.  People erroneously think that there is a correlation because it \"makes sense\" and they fall victim to confirmation bias.",
        "reply_relation": "a",
        "reply_to_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That's a naive view. Had someone else walked in, instead of him, that person would be mugged instead. Which means that the original crime was avoided. If no one walked in, no one would be mugged.\n\nWhich means that one of the causes is *definitely* the person who walks in. No matter how you look at it. No second person, no crime.\n\nThe inflictor is definitely the one to 'blame', however. As we wouldn't want to throw random people into jail simply for being a part of a mugging.\n\nEither way, both the inflictor and victim were the cause. Just as the guy who sold the inflictor a knife/gun was the cause.\n\n&gt;A great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing. First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.\n\nCorrect. The rapist is the inflictor in this case. Had they not been there, the rape would not have occurred (or done by someone else). That said, the victim can certainly do things to lower the chance that someone will rape them. Such as not become drunk in a bar. Certainly that would drastically reduce the chance they'd get raped.\n\nThough honestly, I don't think clothes have much to do with it. But being situationally aware certainly does.\n\n&gt; But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing. People erroneously think that there is a correlation because it \"makes sense\" and they fall victim to confirmation bias.\n\nWell you have to understand why the inflictor is doing such things. Just like the mugger. They aren't doing it to 'be a mugger'. The mugger most likely needs money. So he mugs people for it. Don't have anything on you, and the mugger won't/can't take anything. Results muted. The rapist (from what I understand) wants sexually related power. It's not so much the clothes. In this case, avoid drinks from strangers, be sure to stay mostly sober. And don't uncautiously enter unfamiliar bars.\n\nThe victim is the victim because of their choices. And the victim is half the reason the crime is able to take place.\n\nEdit: It's not like the mugger has it out for OP and will hunt him down. He just mugged the first guy he ran across. Which means OP can definitely make sure it's not him.",

        "reply_to_text": "&gt;The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThis paragraph makes a couple of assumptions involving how our culture views \"cause\" and responsibility.  From a deterministic point of view, where you still have the freedom to choose where you go but everything else is predetermined, you entering a bad area is the \"cause\" of your mugging.  But that doesn't make you responsible for being mugged, because every individual is, legally, recognized as having the same freedom of choice that you have.  So the mugger chose to mug you.  That choice was the \"cause,\" not your decision to enter an unsafe area.\n\nYou increasing your chance of being mugged didn't actually cause your mugging.\n\nMaybe this is just pedantic, because ultimately there is a correlation between entering that area and getting mugged.  However, problems arise when people think they know how certain things correlate when they actually don't.  Humans are actually quite bad at probabilities and intuitively understanding them.  So it then becomes a problem when people think \"i'm not blaming the victim, I'm recognizing a correlation,\" because they don't usually have a good reason to believe that they are really recognizing a correlation.\n\nA great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing.  First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.  But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing.
